Space Battle
============

It's a little game I made in 2013. Now (2022) I updated the game library and corrected a critical bug that prevented to play.

[Play in your browser here](http://etn406.github.io/space-battle) but be aware that you need a mouse and a keyboard.

Keys
----

- Move the spaceship with *ZQSD* or *↑↓←→*, and shoot with the left button on you mouse.

- Show the saved scores on the title screen by pressing *H*.

- Change the game's color by keeping *C* pressed.

- _(debug)_ The key *K* shows/hide enemie's target lasers.

- _(debug)_ The key *H* shows/hide ship's health.

- _(debug)_ The key *L* starts the next level without having to kill al the enemies on screen.
